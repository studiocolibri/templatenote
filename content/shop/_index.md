For our first collection we wanted to start with simple patterns and colors but with a Template Note twist.  
The pages are hand drawn and duplicated using a Risograph.  
The size of the paper was a little bigger than what we needed so we used the extra space to print some fun business cards.  
The wire binding gives you complete freedom to write or draw anywhere on the notebook and the cover protects your pages everywhere you go.
