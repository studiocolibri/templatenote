For as\r  long as I can remember, I’ve been\r  quite obsessed with anything that has\r  to do with pens and paper. As time\r  went on, I grew to become conscious\r  of the impact I could create by\r  efficiently utilising paper. I\r  started growing a collection of\r  pieces of paper I could write on,\r  bills, old notes, misprint paper and\r  more.",

        "description": "The idea behind Template Note sparked\rup when I met Axel from Chez Rosi\rprintshop. He had boxes full of excess\r paper clouding his workspace, and as\r much as he tried to utilise them for\r smaller tasks, it was still an issue. \rOne day I asked him if he had ever \rthought of making notebooks with it and\ra month later, I found myself printing \rthe first test pages.",
