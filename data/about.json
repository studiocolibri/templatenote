For as\r  long as I can remember, I’ve been\r  quite obsessed with anything that has\r  to do with pens and paper. As time\r  went on, I grew to become conscious\r  of the impact I could create by\r  efficiently utilising paper. I\r  started growing a collection of\r  pieces of paper I could write on,\r  bills, old notes, misprint paper and\r  more.",
